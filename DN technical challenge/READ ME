## Overview

The project is a small interface which takes the users data and validates it. 
Once the user has entered their data, if it is valid it will change color to green, if invalid it changes to red.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
  -Javascript

### What I learned

I reallz enjoyed this project as there were a lot of new concepts. Firstly, I learned how i can use Regex to validate a name. 
Using Regex allowed me to make sure that only certain Characters were allowed. The same goes for the email address, which I used regex to make sure the email is a certain format.
I also learned about the LUHN algorithm and how it is used to validate credit card numbers. 
Finally, I got some practice with a 3rd party API, that sends an email when the data is submitted. 

### Continued development

in the future i would like to try this challenge again, but using my own back-end code to implement the data submission
